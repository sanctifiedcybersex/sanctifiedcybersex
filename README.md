# about moi

hi i'm dynnie or lain,,, i use shi/hir and hy/hymn pronouns

i'm 18 years old, and i'm autistic, adhd, etc. like way too much shit lol... like actually too much to list but just trust me when i say there's a lot wrong with both my body and mind

i'm taken by my boyfriend cassian and my qpp kaden :) both of them are also systems <3

ask me about my interests, but don't be mean about them

i have memory loss lollllll being a udd system don't help that one bit

i love kissing objects!!! objectums you are safe with me..

# dni you dumb ho

i don't want tcoaal fans, hazbin/helluva fans, or alfred's playhouse fans interacting. sorry i just feel gross around you people

i will block people who annoy me.. just automatically LOL

if ur a/an: general bigot, zionist, anti-endo, anti-good faith labels, anti-system, anti-kin, anti-recovery, radqueer, or pro-contact for harmful paraphilias... pls go away. i don't like youuuuu :(

if you are a darkshipper stay far away from me pleaaase. especially if you're an adult darkshipper/you are doing it specifically for fun and not to cope with anything. yes it is a coping mechanism, yes it is a bad one. darkshipper communities encourage this type of behavior and it's not good. if you have to cope this way keep it to yourself brah

also, if you are younger than 15 or 14... please don't interact, for your own safety **unless you are asking for either life advice or ponytown help.** i went through a lot of trauma on the internet, and i want kids to be safe. i am not your role model LMFAO

# before you interact i guess....

i'm a proshipper and LIGHT comshipper BY DEFINITION. i may sometimes sit NEAR the protree, but i won't actively associate with those sitting there, especially non-coping darkshippers... the original defintion of proshipper is to be anti-harassment, and for the notion of fandom shipping in general. i do not go out of my way to harass people. i may shittalk you with people i'm close to, but that's it. and a comshipper is someone who ships complicated dynamics. i ship ***legal*** complicated dynamics, because i'm a lightshipper. i am anti most forms of censorship, pro consequences :/

sometimes i will talk about things like smoking, drinking, or other sensitive content that can be an easy trigger. i actively smoke. i've drank, and i've smoked weed before. if you intend on becoming my friend, tell me your triggers so i know to avoid them!!!!

my humor can be stupid, morbid, and dry all at the same time. i can and will also be vulgar! i am a proud pervert but this makes me a bit of a wild card... if i say something you find strange (in a bad way) then pleaseeee tell me. don't keep me in the dark :(

i don't use tone tags necessarily, but i do make my intent obvious,, i will put my intent in parentheses after my message (for example) (seriously). i don't mind if you use tone tags at me or not, but please make your intent obvious as well. i have a habit of overthinking

sometimes i get distant. sometimes i go on hiatus. this doesn't mean that i hate you! i just lose some interest!!!

my memory is horrible... i have forgotten entire members of my family before (and not just distant relatives). if i forget something, tell me again!! i will do things like tell the same story 15 times and not remember the last
